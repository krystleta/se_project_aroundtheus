**Description**
  
Project 8 involves creating new Classes and refactoring code to instantiate the new Classes. Most of the refactoring involves removing functionality from index.js and implementing the functionality within the new Classes. A new utility file "constants" is created to hold the array of initial cards and all the constants used throughout the project.
The next part of the project involves setting up Webpack and bundling.

**Technologies and  techniques**  
  
The technologies and techniques used are refactoring Classes using inheritance which is demonstrated with Popup and its child classes PopupWithForm and PopupWithImage.
